Description: This source code reads XLS file and render as xml(This code reads 1st worksheet. Just change the work sheet according to your requirement 
to read other page). This might be useful  when a client submits large amount of data in xls, we can just convert into xml. 

This can be used when our server does not support any server side language directly to read xls, we can convert xls to xml in local machine 
and in live server we can read xml and render as HTML without any server side scripting)
